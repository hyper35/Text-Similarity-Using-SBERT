# Text-Similarity-Using-SBERT

## Overview

This project provides a graphical user interface (GUI) for calculating the cosine similarity between two pieces of text. It leverages **SBERT (Sentence-BERT)** through the `sentence-transformers` library to encode the text and compute the similarity score. The GUI is built using `tkinter` for ease of use.

## Features

- Enter two pieces of text in the provided text boxes.
- Calculate the cosine similarity between the two texts.
- Display the similarity score in a user-friendly format.

## Installation

To run this project, you'll need Python and the following libraries:

- `sentence-transformers` (which includes SBERT models)
- `tkinter` (usually included with Python)

You can install the required libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install sentence-transformers
